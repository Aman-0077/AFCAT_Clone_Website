						<strong>Ans:</strong> Green Cards are

				</h2>
				<div id="panelsStayOpen-collapse14" class="accordion-collapse collapse"
					aria-labelledby="panelsStayOpen-heading14">
					<div class="accordion-body">
						<strong>Ans:</strong> CSV stands for
						“Certificate Subject to Verification”. This is because, there
						is an anomaly in your documents/certificates. This was
						intimated to you at the time of Selection Test and an
						undertaking was given by you to clear the anomaly and produce
						corrected certificate(s) within the given timeframe. The
						indication of ‘CSV’ against your name in PSL denotes that you
						have to clear the CSV status within the stipulated time. The
						candidature of candidates who fail to get the CSV cleared
						within the stipulated timeframe, gets automatically cancelled
						on the day of enrolment. However, keeping in view the
						procedural delay in Educational Boards, your candidature is not
						cancelled and your CSV status is maintained to avoid
						cancellation of candidature. You are advised to get the anomaly
						cleared by the date as mentioned on the first page of PSL. If
						the CSV is not cleared, your candidature will get automatically
						cancelled on the day of enrolment.

				<div id="panelsStayOpen-collapse15" class="accordion-collapse collapse"

					<div class="accordion-body">
						<strong>Ans:</strong> To clear the CSV
						status, you have to report to Commanding Officer of any one of
